## Description

The objective is to create a game using what i have learned. JS, CSS, HTML. This game will be my interpretation of connect 4, i will be using basic elements i have learned in class to recreate this in a simple project. This game is made up of a ocuple of basic elements that why i chose it, it will give me a better understanding of these topics while being hands on.

## Plans

- I plan on using somewhat the same concepts we have learned creating the tic tac toe game.
- The concept is simillar, but the grid will be larger, and the rules behind the game will be slightly different.
- There will be 7 collumns of 6 cells, when a cell is clicked it will turn (red/blue) depending on the player that clicked it.
- The game will alternate between players after each click of a cell, when a player is able to click 4 boxes ina row, they win
- When they win, Winner will be prompted on the screen

## Basic Elements of Game

- Landing page
- Title
- Gameboard
- Game chips
- Restart button
- Winning array
- Eventlisteners
- Check board function
- Grid cell checker

## Summary

To summarize this project, i used html, javascript, and css to create a connect 4 game that is fully functional & deploy it online. during this project i came accross a several issues that made it difficult for me to continue. one thing that really helped me was thinking out my code before i type it, i realized that anything can be achieved using code. most tasks in real life that you want to implement in a program are basically just a longer list of smaller tasks that equte to that, and thinking in this way helped me get a better understanding of what is goin on, and with practice of syntax, fixing errors became less frustrating and less feeling like i hit a wall, and feeling more like a riddle im trying to translate to the computer. Overall this project was a huge learning experience for me and i feel slightly better coding than i did before.
