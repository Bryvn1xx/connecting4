## Description

The objective is to create a game using what i have learned. JS, CSS, HTML. This game will be my interpretation of connect 4, i will be using basic elements i have learned in class to recreate this in a simple project. This game is made up of a ocuple of basic elements that why i chose it, it will give me a better understanding of these topics while being hands on.

## Plans

- i plan on using somewhat the same concepts we have learned creating the tic tac toe game.
- the concept is simillar, but the grid will be larger, and the rules behind the game will be slightly different.
- there will be 7 collumns of 6 cells, when a cell is clicked it will turn (red/blue) depending on the player that clicked it.
- the game will alternate between players after each click of a cell, when a player is able to click 4 boxes ina row, they win
- when they win, Winner will be prompted on the screen

## Resources

## Backup
- my backup choice would be an easy card game like blackjack. where player one and two both battle to see who can get closer to 21 without going over. i feel this is anoter simple project with logic that should not be too hard or complex.
